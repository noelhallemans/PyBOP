class BaseCost:
    """
    Base class for defining cost functions.

    This class is intended to be subclassed to create specific cost functions
    for evaluating model predictions against a set of data. The cost function
    quantifies the goodness-of-fit between the model predictions and the
    observed data, with a lower cost value indicating a better fit.

    Parameters
    ----------
    problem : object
        A problem instance containing the data and functions necessary for
        evaluating the cost function.
    _target : array-like
        An array containing the target data to fit.
    x0 : array-like
        The initial guess for the model parameters.
    bounds : tuple
        The bounds for the model parameters.
    n_parameters : int
        The number of parameters in the model.
    n_outputs : int
        The number of outputs in the model.
